## 360-in-525-1: Introduction to Apache Spark for Data Scientists on **April 20 2018**

See [https://lamastex.github.io/scalable-data-science/360-in-525/2018/01/](https://lamastex.github.io/scalable-data-science/360-in-525/2018/01/).

## 360-in-525-2: Social Media and Big Data on **April 26 2018**

<!---
This is a two-full-days workshop (2 hp) on April 26-27 2018. Prerequisites: 360-in-525-1 or Introduction to data Science (the Fall 2017 UU inter-faculty course). The first day will be an introduction to the domain by Professor Simon Lindgren, a digital sociologist from Umea and the second day will build towards making one’s own twitter experimental designs in real-time. This module will introduce you to topic modeling and other simple pipelines in natural language processing.
The course will give you the basic skills needed to go further and investigate the influence, if any, of micro propaganda machines (as shown below) or other similar opinion engineering operations, for instance.

I have tried to get every citizen to be sceptical and participate in the democratic process today.

* Lunch
  - you can buy sandwiches or have a full meal in cafes nearby.

* 1330-1500 hours; (181-270 of 360 Minutes): Getting your hands dirty to visually explore on Jupyter for digital sociology
  - Simon Lindgren Jupyter notebook based stuff with twitter data, networks visual, Nlp etc.
    - **NOTE:** There is no software requirements from students as we will abstract away the code and just focus on what each code cell executed by Simon is doing for gaining insights of interest to digital humanities. *We will learn Python-on-Jupyter in 360-in-525-4*.
    - Just relax and enjoy Simon's live show!

* Fika break 30 minutes - sponsored by [Combient AB](https://combient.com/)

  - On *inferential thinking* for digital sociology and humanities
  - What is the Data? Why did people support the printing and archiving of court proceedings in London's Old Bailey Court? etc.
  - Illustrating *inferential thinking* on the ``English Civilizing Process'' from [Old Bailey Online](https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/) dataset as XML files:
    - for example, did capital punishment for offence types really change between 1673 and 1911 in London?
  - Fusing *inferential thinking* with *computational thinking* in one place using Apache Spark (same code can scale to petabytes, if needed!)
    - It's time to *lock and load* into your own databricks Community Edition at [https://community.cloud.databricks.com/](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/) and play with data parsing from raw xml files in order to get the data that went in as input to the inferential thinking process above using the following databricks notebook.

This is a two-full-days workshop (2 hp) on May 3-4 2018. Prerequisites: 360-in-525-1 or Introduction to data Science. The first day will be done by domain experts from Uppsala University’s Department of Social and Economic Geography in order to introduce the basic problems and datasets of the field with hands-on lab tutorials in non-distributed geospatial analytics. The second day will be on distributed geospatial analytics over real datasets that can be scaled to petabytes (syllabus is jointly designed with experts in London’s big data industry). Topics include efficient distributed spatial joins, ingestion and representations of Open Street Maps that are conducive to pregel-style distributed vertex programs, SparkSQL and Spark Machine Learning pipelines with spatiotemporal GPS trajectories of multiple individuals.

## 360-in-525-4: Mathematical, Statistical and Computational Foundations for Data Scientists on **May 11 2018**

This is a mathematically more careful (``deeper'' or ``advanced'' undergraduate) version of UC Berkeley's most popular freshman course:
 - [http://data8.org/](http://data8.org/) with the formula:
   - **computatioal thinking + inferential thinking  = data science** 
   - as talked about at the end [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggq7HiDO0OU).

## 360-in-525-5: Population Genetics and Big Data (1 hp)  on **May 31 2018** 

**hp change:** *due to complicated scheduling issues 360-in-525-5 is now only 1hp for one full day. If you want to do it as a 2hp course then there may be possibilities for supervised projects on genome scale population demographic inference. Please talk to Raaz if you want to do a 2hp version.*
<!---
Two-full-day workshops (2 hp) on May 31 and June 1 2018. The first day will be on the basic theories in current population genetics and genomics. The second day will use ADAM and possibly Hail over Apache Spark. Prerequisite for May 31 is 360-in-525-4 or equivalent and for June 1 is 360-in-525-1 or Introduction to data Science. We will focus on Extract-Load-Transform operations and subsequent analysis for the 1000 genomes project.

## 360-in-525-0: Mathematical Statistical Learning Theory Series; An L1 View (1 hp) **June 1 2018**
<!---
  - Lecture Plan
    - Do a full day of X-lectures (and some explicit tree arithmetics if time permits) to understand the Theorems in [YatracosThis](http://lamastex.org/preprints/20180405_MDEYatracosThis.pdf) 
    - (Optionally, depending on audience C++ skills) dive from within docker into: [https://github.com/lamastex/mrs2/tree/master/companions/mrs-1.0-YatracosThis](https://github.com/lamastex/mrs2/tree/master/companions/mrs-1.0-YatracosThis) **Pre-Action:** Gloria needs to write a README on how to run the example on Table I in [YatracosThis](http://lamastex.org/preprints/20180405_MDEYatracosThis.pdf).
