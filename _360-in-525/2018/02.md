         '','This course will introduce a PhD student in mathematics or mathematical statistics to one of the fundamental problems at the very core of various probabilistic theories of decision-making. We will mainly focus on the relation between the combinatorial geometric complexity of the (sigma) algebras of a simple measurable space and the rates of convergence of empirical measures over them in one of the simplest posable decision problems – nonparametric density estimation of an unknown density f in L1 based on finitely many observations drawn independently from it, but without making any mathematical compromise whatsoever, and thereby giving the so-called universal performance guarantee. This course was given in another form at CMAP, Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France for PhD students in mathematics there. Students in Geometry and Combinatorial probability as well as analysis may find this course insightful for their own research, as one of the basic theorems involves the combined use of several unique inequalities in a specific partial order of implications. The emphasis will involve constructive mathematics and perhaps delve into tree arithmetics towards such decision with universal performance guarantees along with their combinatorial, algebraic and analytic properties if time permits. Unfortunately such guarantees are not available for big data sets and may be necessary for being able to impose legal requirements and standards on automated decision-making systems.']

# [360-in-525-2: Social Media and Big Data](https://lamastex.github.io/scalable-data-science/360-in-525/2018/02/)
This is a two-full-days workshop (2 hp) on **April 26-27 2018**. Prerequisites: 360-in-525-1 or [Introduction to data Science](https://lamastex.github.io/scalable-data-science/sds/2/2/) (the Fall 2017 UU inter-faculty course). The first day will be an introduction to the domain by [Professor Simon Lindgren, a digital sociologist from Umea](http://www.simonlindgren.com/) and the second day will build towards making one's own twitter experimental designs in real-time. 
This module will introduce you to topic modeling and other simple pipelines in natural language processing.  
The course will give you the basic skills needed to go further and investigate the influence, if any, of [micro propaganda machines](https://medium.com/@d1gi/the-election2016-micro-propaganda-machine-383449cc1fba) (as shown below) or other similar opinion engineering operations, for instance.

We will ingest global news streams from the [gdelt project](https://www.gdeltproject.org/) with embeddings and models to gain insights into current affairs (see below).
