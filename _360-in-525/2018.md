# Overview of a 360-in-525 Minutes Course Set in Data Sciences, Spring 2018

**For PhD Students at Uppsala University and Researchers who want to upskill for Data Industry**


There will be several full-day workshop-style courses (360 minutes-long, with the usual three 15-minutes-long breaks before and after the 75-minutes-long lunch break in the 525 minutes from 0815 to 1700 hours CET) worth 1hp to 3hp credits each. 
This is partly supported by the Centre for Interdisciplinary Mathematics jointly with the Department of Mathematics in Spring 2018 and taught by domain experts in Digital Sociology, Geospatial Analytics, Population Genetics and Mathematical Statistics. 

Master students at Uppsala University must contact their study councellor in order to see if it is possible to take the course as a "Selected Topics Course" in their Department.

If you are working in industry and want to upskill in data science then you can take the courses (free of cost) and receive a certificate from the Department of Mathematics upon successful completion.

See our [Plan of Action (POA)](POA/) for the course set including timings and order of topics as they fall in place.

#### What is expected in a 1hp Course at Uppsala University?
Learning concepts in depth and familiarizing one self with new syntax requires completion of watching/reading assignments and completion of homework exercises. At Uppsala University, 1hp is about 25 hours of work and there is plenty of time, outside the 6-8 hours of face-to-face lab/lecture meetings, for deepening one's understanding.  

# [360-in-525-1: Introduction to Apache Spark for Data Scientists](https://lamastex.github.io/scalable-data-science/360-in-525/2018/01/)
This is a one-full-day workshop (1 hp) on **April 20 2018** on [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), one of the most widely used open-source and commercially friendly software for analysing big data in industry and academia. 
A crash course in Scala, the language of Apache Spark, will be followed by introduction to resilient distributed datasets (RDDs), their transformations and actions, Spark DataSets and DataFrames, SparkSQL.  We will have brief teasers on ML Pipelines, Streaming and GraphX as they will be covered in-depth in the sequel modules. 

# [360-in-525-2: Social Media and Big Data](https://lamastex.github.io/scalable-data-science/360-in-525/2018/02/)
This is a two-full-days workshop (2 hp) on **April 26-27 2018**. Prerequisites: 360-in-525-1 or [Introduction to data Science](https://lamastex.github.io/scalable-data-science/sds/2/2/) (the Fall 2017 UU inter-faculty course). The first day will be an introduction to the domain by [Professor Simon Lindgren, a digital sociologist from Umea](http://www.simonlindgren.com/) and the second day will build towards making one's own twitter experimental designs in real-time. 
This module will introduce you to topic modeling and other simple pipelines in natural language processing.  
The course will give you the basic skills needed to go further and investigate the influence, if any, of [micro propaganda machines](https://medium.com/@d1gi/the-election2016-micro-propaganda-machine-383449cc1fba) (as shown below) or other similar opinion engineering operations, for instance.

We will ingest global news streams from the [gdelt project](https://www.gdeltproject.org/) with embeddings and models to gain insights into current affairs (see below).

The first day will be done by domain experts from Uppsala University's [Department of Social and Economic Geography](http://www.kultgeog.uu.se/?languageId=1) in order to introduce the basic problems and datasets of the field with hands-on lab tutorials in non-distributed geospatial analytics. 
The second day will be on distributed geospatial analytics over real datasets that can be scaled to petabytes (syllabus is jointly designed with experts in London's big data industry). 
Topics include efficient distributed spatial joins, ingestion and representations of Open Street Maps that are conducive to pregel-style distributed vertex programs, SparkSQL and Spark Machine Learning pipelines with spatiotemporal GPS trajectories of multiple individuals.

Meeting time for this 1-day-workshop is TBA via doodle. 

This course will introduce a PhD student in mathematics or mathematical statistics to one of the fundamental problems at the very core of various probabilistic theories of decision-making.  
We will mainly focus on the relation between the combinatorial geometric complexity of the (sigma) algebras of a simple measurable space and the rates of convergence of empirical measures over them in one of the simplest posable decision problems -- *nonparametric density estimation* of an unknown density f in L1 based on finitely many observations drawn independently from it, but without making any mathematical compromise whatsoever, and thereby giving the so-called *universal performance guarantee* . 

This course was given in another form at CMAP, Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France for PhD students in mathematics there. Students in Geometry and Combinatorial probability as well as analysis may find this course insightful for their own research, as one of the basic theorems involves the combined use of several unique inequalities in a specific partial order of implications.

The emphasis will involve constructive mathematics and perhaps delve into tree arithmetics towards such decision with universal performance guarantees along with their combinatorial, algebraic and analytic properties if time permits. Unfortunately such guarantees are not available for big data sets and may be necessary for being able to impose legal requirements and standards on automated decision-making systems.
